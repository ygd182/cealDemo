# AngularJS GapCarsDemo Application

## Overview



## Prerequisites

### Git

- A good place to learn about setting up git is [here][git-github].
- Git [home][git-home] (download, documentation).

### Node.js and Tools

- Get [Node.js][node-download].
- Install the tool dependencies (`npm install`).


##Proxy

Remember to remove or add proxy on git, npm and bower if necessary

## Development with angular-phonecat

The following docs describe how you can test and develop further this application.


### Installing dependencies

The application relies upon various node.js tools, such as Bower, Karma and Protractor.  You can
install these by running:

```
npm install
```

This will also run bower, which will download the angular files needed for the current step of the
tutorial.

Most of the scripts described below will run this automatically but it doesn't do any harm to run
it whenever you like.

### Running the app during development

- Run `npm start`
- navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html` to see the app running in your browser.
